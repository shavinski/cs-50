Binary digit - origin for the bit, which is a 0 and 1 
-largest value you can have in a bit is 255 and lowest is 0

-Computers have transistors that turn on and off, that keep track of 0's and 1's 
-If your computer wants to represent a one it turns on the transistor if it wants 
to represent a 0 then it is turned off 

-Base-2 aka binary 
-Base-10 aka decimal 

-Bytes are more useful than bits, there are 8 bits in one byte
-All letters are mapped to a decimal number, both lower case and uppercase 
-This was agreed upon a group of people, called Asci 
-When you open a text message it is 0's and 1's, patterns of 0's and 1's translated 
as letters from your phone
-A sequence of bytes that are translated so that we can understand 

-Problem with Asci is that it doesn't represent other cultures symbols/alphabets
-Example with emojis are a new character not thought about 
-So how do we represent these now? Add another digit, add more bytes 
-Solution to limitation of Asci is unicode
-Unicode goal is to capture digitally all forms of human language

-Each pixel on a screen is 3 bits, to represent the color, RGB

-Abstraction, not worrying about what is happening behind the scenes
-Implementation details, the instructions/details to solve an algorithm
